# Anthony Axenov

Hi. 
I am backend developer.

I have experience in e-commerce and government healthcare-solutions development, RESTful APIs, server monitoring and maintenance, and special business solutions (such as sending SMS via an asterisk gateway or ticket terminals).

You can find my pet-projects in my **[Gitea](http://git.axenov.dev/explore/repos)**.

Also I use my own **[Opengist](http://gist.axenov.dev/)** for code snippets.

Feel free to contact me via **Telegram**: [@anthonyaxenov](https://t.me/anthonyaxenov).
